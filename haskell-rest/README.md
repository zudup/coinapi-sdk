# Haskell CoinApi REST API Library

## Installation

* `cd haskell-rest/`
* `cabal install`

There are two interfaces in the library:
* One being in `CoinApi`, in which the functions take the api key as an argument.
* The other from `CoinApi.Monadic`, in which the api key is stored within a State monad.

## Examples
* `cd haskell-rest/`
* `cabal run examples`
