### Authentication
If the software is deployed as `Self-Hosted` then API do not require authentication as inside your infrastructure, your company is responsible for the security and access controls. 
<br/><br/>
If the software is deployed in our `Managed Cloud`, there are 2 methods for authenticating with us, you only need to use one:

 1. Custom authorization header named `X-CoinAPI-Key` with the API Key
 2. Query string parameter named `apikey` with the API Key
 3. <a href=\"#certificate\">TLS Client Certificate</a> from the `Managed Cloud REST API` (/v1/certificate/pem endpoint) while establishing a TLS session with us.

#### Custom authorization header
You can authorize by providing additional custom header named `X-CoinAPI-Key` and API key as its value.
Assuming that your API key is `73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY`, then the authorization header you should send to us will look like:
<br/><br/>
`X-CoinAPI-Key: 73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY`
<aside class=\"success\">This method is recommended by us and you should use it in production environments.</aside>
#### Query string authorization parameter
You can authorize by providing an additional parameter named `apikey` with a value equal to your API key in the query string of your HTTP request.
Assuming that your API key is `73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY` and that you want to request all balances, then your query string should look like this: 
<br/><br/>
`GET /v1/balances?apikey=73034021-THIS-IS-SAMPLE-KEY`
<aside class=\"notice\">Query string method may be more practical for development activities.</aside>

cmake -DCPPREST_ROOT=/usr -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include" -DCMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib"
make
```

### Build on Windows with Visual Studio (VS2017)

- Right click on folder containing source code
- Select 'Open in visual studio'
- Once visual studio opens, CMake should show up in top menu bar.
- Select CMake > Build All.

*Note: If the CMake menu item doesn't show up in Visual Studio, CMake
for Visual Studio must be installed. In this case, open the 'Visual Studio
