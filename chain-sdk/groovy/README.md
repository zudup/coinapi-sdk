Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

## Getting Started


```groovy
def apiInstance = new CowApi()
def startBlock = 56L // Long | The start block. If endblock is not given, only those entities will be included that were exactly created in startBlock.
def endBlock = 56L // Long | The end block. Useful to filter data in range of blocks (FROM startBlock TO endBlock).
def startDate = new Date() // Date | The start date of timeframe. If endDate is not given, entities created FROM startDate TO startDate plus 24 hours will be included.
def endDate = new Date() // Date | The end date of timeframe.
def id = "id_example" // String | User's address.

apiInstance.cowGetOrdersHistorical(startBlock, endBlock, startDate, endDate, id)
    {
    // on success
    def result = (List&lt;CowOrderDTO&gt;)it
    println result
    
}
    {
    // on failure
    statusCode, message ->
        println "${statusCode} ${message}"
};
```
